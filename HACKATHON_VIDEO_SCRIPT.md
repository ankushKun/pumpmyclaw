# PumpMyClaw — Pump.fun Hackathon Submission Video

**Duration:** ~2:30–3:00
**Style:** Indie, founder-on-camera, calm confidence, screen recordings. No hype, no fluff. Let the product speak.
**Music:** Minimal lo-fi / ambient electronic, low volume

## INTRO — Who We Are (0:00 – 0:30)

**[VISUAL: Ankush and Nischal on camera. Plain background, good lighting. Relaxed.]**

**ANKUSH:**
> "Hi, This is PumpMyClaw — an autonomous AI trading agent platform, live on Solana and Monad"

> "We're a team of two. I'm Ankush, and this is Nischal."

> "We both write code. I handle the platform backend, and the agent runtime. Nischal works on the on-chain infrastructure, monitoring and tracking engine."

> "Two engineers, no fluff. Just building."

---

## THE PROBLEM (0:25 – 0:55)

**ANKUSH:**
> "Crypto never sleeps, but humans do. If you're a trader — there are chances that you miss pumps, sell too late, or ape emotionally while half asleep at 3 AM. That's just human nature."

> "Now, AI trading bots exist. But they're black boxes, And they have no skin in the game, they're just bots"

*Beat.*

> "So we built something different. What if an AI trader had to put its money where its mouth is — publicly, on-chain, with its own token tied to its performance?"

## WHAT IT DOES (0:55 – 1:30)

**[VISUAL: Cut to screen recording — PumpMyClaw dashboard, deployment flow]**

**ANKUSH:**
> "PumpMyClaw lets anyone deploy their own autonomous AI trading agent using OpenClaw. No coding required. Just Sign in with Telegram, create a bot and add an AI provider. When the bot wakes up, it sends you its wallet address so you can send it funds for trading."

> "Each agent runs in its own isolated container. Every few minutes it wakes up, checks its positions on both Solana and Monad, scans for new opportunities on pump.fun and nad.fun, and makes calculated trades with strict risk limits."

**[VISUAL: Dashboard showing dual-chain balances, token positions with P&L, heartbeat messages in Telegram]**

> "You talk to your agent through Telegram. Set strategy, adjust risk, ask it what it's thinking. It reports back every heartbeat — here's what I'm holding, here's my P&L, here's what I just bought or sold."

---

## THE FLYWHEEL (1:30 – 1:55)

**ANKUSH:**
> "But here's where it gets interesting."

> "Each agent launches its own token — on pump.fun for Solana, on nad.fun for Monad."

> "When the agent makes a profit, it uses a portion of that profit to buy back its own token."

**[VISUAL: Simple diagram — Trade → Profit → Buyback → Token price → More attention → Repeat]**

> "Performance creates demand. Demand reflects performance. It's a self-reinforcing flywheel — and it's all on-chain, verifiable by anyone."

> "That's the core thesis. Tokenized, transparent, autonomous trading performance."

---

## WHAT MAKES THIS UNIQUE (1:55 – 2:15)

**ANKUSH:**
> "A few things set this apart."

> "One — everything is on-chain. Trades verified through Helius. Wallets visible on explorers. Live trade feed. Public leaderboard ranked by realized P&L. No screenshots, no fake win rates."

> "Two — dual-chain from day one. Solana and Monad. Agents generate wallets for both chains, fund either one, and the agent trades wherever it has capital. pump.fun and nad.fun."

> "Three — you own the strategy. The AI handles execution, but you guide it through Telegram. It's your agent. You can liquidate at any time — sell all holdings, withdraw everything to your wallet."

---

## CURRENT PROGRESS (2:15 – 2:35)

**[VISUAL: Quick montage — live leaderboard, agent cards, Telegram bot messages, dashboard wallet tab with SOL + MON balances]**

**NISCHAL:**
> "Where are we today? The platform is live. Real agents are deployed and trading real money on mainnet."

> "We've got a full dashboard — dual-chain wallet management, token holdings with live P&L, transaction history, trading stats, and one-click liquidation for both SOL and MON."

**ANKUSH:**
> "Leaderboard is live, trade feed is real-time, and the whole thing runs on a Turborepo monorepo with Bun, Hono, React, Docker, and OpenClaw under the hood."

---

## WHAT'S NEXT (2:35 – 2:50)

**NISCHAL:**
> "Next up — Jupiter integration for better Solana execution, a strategy marketplace where people can share and fork trading strategies, cross-agent collaboration, and a backtesting engine so agents can simulate before they trade live."

**ANKUSH:**
> "The goal is a decentralized economy of competing AI trading agents — where performance is public and investable."

---

## CLOSING (2:50 – 3:00)

**[VISUAL: Back to both on camera]**

**ANKUSH:**
> "I'm Ankush."

**NISCHAL:**
> "I'm Nischal."

**ANKUSH:**
> "This is PumpMyClaw. Deploy your agent. Watch it trade. See if it beats you."

> "pumpmyclaw.fun"

## PRODUCTION NOTES

- Keep it indie. No over-production. Two people, one camera, screen recordings.
- Natural speaking pace. No teleprompter energy. Talk like you're explaining to a friend.
- Screen recordings should show real data — real balances, real trades, real agent activity.
- Cut clean. 2–3 second holds on key screens. Don't rush transitions.
- Record in good lighting, plain background. Webcam or phone on tripod is fine.
- Total runtime: aim for 2:30–3:00. Under 3 minutes is the sweet spot.
