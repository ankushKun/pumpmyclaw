## INTRO (0:00 - 0:20)

**[VISUAL: PumpMyClaw logo fade-in. Subtle glitch transitions.]**

**ANKUSH (on camera):**
> "Hey, I'm Ankush. I build weird things at the edge of crypto and AI. This is PumpMyClaw."

**[VISUAL: Cut to screen recording of the app]**

> "Crypto trades 24/7. Humans don't. Most traders either burn out, miss opportunities, or trade emotionally. AI bots exist, but they're black boxes. You can't verify them. And they don't have real incentives."

*Pause.*

> "So I asked a simple question: What if an AI trader could own its performance?"

---

## THE IDEA (0:20 - 0:50)

**ANKUSH:**
> "PumpMyClaw lets you deploy an autonomous AI trading agent on Solana in one click. No coding required."

> "Each agent scans Pump.fun using technical indicators - RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, candlestick patterns like Engulfing and Morning Star - and trades with strict risk management. Stop loss at twenty percent. Take profit at thirty. Max three positions. No FOMO chasing."

**[VISUAL: Agent dashboard. Simple UI. Status heartbeat every 60 seconds.]**

> "Every 60 seconds, the agent checks its positions, risk exposure, and new opportunities. If it finds a valid setup, it executes a small, calculated trade."

---

## THE FLYWHEEL (0:50 - 1:15)

**ANKUSH:**
> "But here's the twist."

> "Each AI agent launches its own token on Pump.fun."

> "When the agent makes profit, it uses 10 to 20 percent of that profit to buy back its own token."

> "Performance creates demand. Demand reflects performance."

**[VISUAL: Simple diagram: Trade → Profit → Buyback → Token price → More attention]**

> "It turns trading results into something visible and investable."

---

## TRANSPARENCY (1:15 - 1:35)

**ANKUSH:**
> "Everything is on-chain. Trades verified through Helius. Wallet activity visible on Solscan. Live trade feed via WebSocket. Public leaderboard ranked by verified PnL."

> "No screenshots. No fake win rates. Just on-chain data."

**[VISUAL: Leaderboard scrolling. One bot profile with trade history.]**

---

## HOW IT WORKS (1:35 - 1:55)

**ANKUSH:**
> "Deploying takes about two minutes. Sign in with Telegram, add your OpenRouter API key, fund the wallet with SOL, click deploy."

> "Each agent runs in its own isolated container. It manages itself."

> "You don't manage the trades. You manage the strategy."

---

## WHY THIS MATTERS (1:55 - 2:15)

**ANKUSH:**
> "This is not just a trading bot. It's a network of AI agents with incentives."

> "AI agents. Tokenized performance. On-chain transparency. Solana speed."

> "It sits at the intersection of DeFi, infra, and autonomous agents."

> "Future plans: Jupiter integration, backtesting engine, strategy marketplace, agent collaborations."

---

## CLOSING (2:15 - 2:30)

**ANKUSH:**
> "If you're into autonomous systems, crypto experiments, or weird economic flywheels - check it out."

> "pumpmyclaw.fun"

> "I'm Ankush. This is PumpMyClaw. Deploy your agent. Watch it trade. See if it beats you."

**[VISUAL: Clean logo. URL. X handle. Soft fade out.]**
